# Documentation

This part of the repository is meant to handle the documentation and usage of various components, objects, utils, etc within the project.

For example I've started with two main areas that I want to approach first being:

- Components
- Utils

Components are React components that are used within the project.

Utils are something else, I'm not really sure what the criteria is for a utility, and how its different from a helper. However, anything that isn't a component will be designated a component unless stated otherwise.
